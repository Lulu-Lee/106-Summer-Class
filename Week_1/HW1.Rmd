## Introduction to R

### * Calcutation

```{r}
1 + 18
```
```{r}
410 - 410
```
```{r}
9 * 15
```
```{r}
3 / 3
```
```{r}
478 %% 126
```
###### note: %% means what was left after "/" (餘數)



### * Matrix 



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
